        <Paragraph idClass={"a"}>
          The most important event for me recently was the choice between.
          Belarus and Lithuania. This choice does not seem so serious, but for
          me it meant everything: whether I would stay with my old friends,
          family, or whether I would follow my dream to distant and unknown
          lands. You already know what I came to, but I would still like to tell
          you about all the pros and cons that I had to weigh when making this
          decision

        <Paragraph idClass={"b"} header={"Belarus"}>
          On the one hand, of course, I would like to tell you about my
          homeland. Belarus has always fascinated me with its people, who are
          kind and as pleasant to communicate with as possible. I would gladly
          choose to continue my studies here, it would be much easier from the
          monetary and moral side, but this is where the significant advantages
          end. Since my dream has always been to become an actress, there would
          be no future for me in Belarus, due to the lack of educational
          institutions and proper industry. But I could have given up my dream,
          acted like hundreds and thousands of my peers, joined some boring
          banker or accountant, yes, these professions would have given me a
          stable income and confidence in the future. But this is not about me,
          I crave adventure, I want more, so changing my profession to another
          was not an option.

        <ImageContainer href={"/images/Lithuania.jpg"} idClass={"rtetcm"} />

        <Paragraph idClass={"v"} header={"Lithuania"}>
          on the other hand, Lithuania was waiting for me, in which everything
          was the opposite, I would have been separated from all my friends, but
          I would have achieved the dream of my childhood, so I made my choice
          in favor of Lithuania. And I believe that I did not regret my choice,
          because despite all the difficulties and loneliness that I experienced
          on my way, I was still able to meet wonderful people in Lithuania and
          find beauty in these parts
        </Paragraph>

        <Que idClass={"dlk"} header={"reflection"}>
          For me, this essay had a very great personal significance, as I was
          able to group all the decisions that I had made and looked at them in
          a new way. And I can safely say that it helped me set new goals.
